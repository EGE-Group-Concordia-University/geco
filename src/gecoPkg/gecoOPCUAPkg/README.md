# OPC UA Server Geco Package

## Overview
This package provides an OPC UA server using the open62541 library. Depending on the build configuration, the open62541 library can either be included directly into the package (static linking) or linked externally as a shared library.

## Dependencies
The open62541 library ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/open62541/open62541)) needs to be installed either as a shared library or built as a static library if you want to include it directly into the Geco OPC UA package.

## Building open62541
Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions: [open62541 Build Guide](https://www.open62541.org/doc/1.0/building.html#building-the-library).

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open62541/open62541.git
   cd open62541
   ```

2. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git build-essential gcc pkg-config cmake python
   ```

3. **Initialize and update submodules**:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. **Create a `build` folder inside the `open62541` directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

5. **Configure the build process**:
   - For a **shared library**:
     ```bash
     cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
     ```
   - For a **static library**:
     ```bash
     cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
     ```
   > **Note**: The `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` flag controls whether the library is built as shared (`ON`) or static (`OFF`).

6. **Build the library**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will create either a shared or static library depending on the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` flag set in step 5.

7. **Install the shared library**:
   If a shared library was built, install it system-wide:
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   sudo ldconfig
   ```

8. **Getting the static library**:
   The static library `libopen62541.a` will typically be found in the `bin` folder of your `build` directory. Copy it to the folder of this Geco package:
   ```bash
   cp build/bin/libopen62541.a /path/to/geco/package
   ```

### Notes
As of now, there is an open issue ([#6765](https://github.com/open62541/open62541/issues/6765)) that prevents the latest version of open62541 from being fully compatible with C++ projects. To work around this issue, use the version from commit `2babcfc`. To retrieve that specific commit:
```bash
git checkout 2babcfc
```

### Building Open62541 for Raspberry Pi (Cross-Compilation)
It is recommended to cross-compile on a more powerful machine rather than directly on the Raspberry Pi.

#### **1. Clone the Official Raspberry Pi Toolchain**
First, clone the Raspberry Pi toolchain repository into your home directory:
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git ~/rpi-tools
```

#### **2. Add the Toolchain File for Cross-Compilation**
Create a file named `toolchain-rpi.cmake` in the root of the Open62541 project folder with the following content:

```cmake
# Specify the cross-compilation toolchain
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

# Path to the Raspberry Pi tools directory
SET(TOOLCHAIN_ROOT "$ENV{HOME}/rpi-tools/arm-bcm2708/arm-linux-gnueabihf")

# Specify the compiler
SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${TOOLCHAIN_ROOT}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${TOOLCHAIN_ROOT}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++)

# Specify the linker and archiver
SET(CMAKE_AR ${TOOLCHAIN_ROOT}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-ar)
SET(CMAKE_LINKER ${TOOLCHAIN_ROOT}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld)

# Specify the sysroot for the Raspberry Pi
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH ${TOOLCHAIN_ROOT}/arm-linux-gnueabihf/sysroot)

# Search paths
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

#### **3. Create a Build Directory**
Create a `build` directory within the Open62541 project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

#### **4. Configure the Build Process**
Run `cmake` to configure the build with the toolchain file and appropriate settings for the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain-rpi.cmake \
      -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Linux \
      -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=armv7 \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```
This command tells `CMake` to use the specified toolchain and cross-compile for the ARM architecture with the Raspberry Pi's system specifics.

#### **5. Build the Shared Library**
Once the configuration is complete, run `make` to build the shared library:

```bash
make
```

#### **6. Verify the Architecture of the Built Library**
Ensure that the library was compiled for the ARM architecture by running the `file` command on the shared library:
```bash
file bin/libopen62541.so.1.4.6
```
The expected output should be:
```bash
bin/libopen62541.so.1.4.6: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped
```
This confirms the library is built for the Raspberry Pi's ARM architecture.

#### **7. Transfer and Install the Library on the Raspberry Pi**
Transfer the compiled shared library to your Raspberry Pi using `scp` or another method. For example:

```bash
scp bin/libopen62541.so.1.4.6 pi@raspberrypi:/tmp
```

Once the file is on your Raspberry Pi, install it system-wide:
```bash
# Copy the library to /usr/local/lib
sudo cp /tmp/libopen62541.so.1.4.6 /usr/local/lib/

# Create symbolic links for versioning
cd /usr/local/lib/
sudo ln -s libopen62541.so.1.4.6 libopen62541.so.1
sudo ln -s libopen62541.so.1 libopen62541.so

# Update the linker cache
sudo ldconfig
```
This ensures the library is available to all applications on your Raspberry Pi and the system knows where to find it.

## Building the Geco OPC UA Package
After building the open62541 library, proceed with building the Geco OPC UA package.

### Folder Structure Example
Make sure your project is organized like this (`libopen62541.a` only needed if you plan to include into the geco package):
```
project-root/
├── gecoOPCUAPkg.cc
├── gecoOPCUAServer.cc
├── gecoOPCUAPkg.h
├── gecoOPCUAServer.h
├── Makefile
└── libopen62541.a
```

### Build Options
There are two options for building the package, depending on whether you want to include the open62541 library or link to it externally.

1. **Linking against the shared library of open62541**:
   To build the package without including the open62541 library:
   ```bash
   make OPEN62541_LINK_TYPE=SHARED
   ```
   This means that Geco applications using this package must also link against the shared library of open62541.

2. **Including the open62541 library into the OPC UA package**:
   To build the package by statically including the open62541 library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This way, Geco applications can use this package even if the open62541 library is not installed system-wide.

   > **Note**: If `OPEN62541_LINK_TYPE` is not specified, the build defaults to including the static library.

## Cleaning Up
To clean up the build directory, use:
```bash
make clean
```

## Installation
To install the package:
```bash
make install
```
This will copy the compiled package to `/usr/local/share/geco/pkg/` and update the shared library cache with:
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```
